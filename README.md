Terminology

- Delete means destructive "it is gone". Deleting a Tag will remove all traces
of the tag, including the "Tag" object itself
- Removing means "remove from". As in Remove Tag A from Item X.
- Tag means "to tag". As in "Tag Item X". Here we generaly favor "TagBy" as the
nomenclature. This is an additive operation!
